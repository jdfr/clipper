This is a fork of the C++ version of Angus Johnson's excellent ClipperLib library: http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php

Main differences:

-it is patched to use native 128 bit integer multiplication if available (with Visual Studio's intrinsics and GCC's __int128)

-simple IO functions for ClipperLib::Paths and related types are added in a separate file

-it is patched to optionally use a very simple and potentially very fast custom allocator instead of std::allocator.
PLEASE NOTE: this feature breaks drop-in compatibility with he original ClipperLib, because the custom allocator
is not default-constructible and the underlying infrastructure must be cleaned up after each clipping operation.
However, adaptation should require only minimal changes for most applications.

Please note: as the original ClipperLib, this is intended to be source-included (rather than linked) in other projects
